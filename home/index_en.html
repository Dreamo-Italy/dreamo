front-subheading: Our idea
front-testo: "<p>What if a device was able to read and display emotions, making unique your musical and artistic performance?</p>
<p>Dreamo is the perfect match between technology and human emotions. <br>
The purpose of Dreamo is to generate a graphical display representing the artist's emotions and the mood of music </p>
<p>On the basis of aesthetic and psychological principles, Dreamo generates an abstract video in real time by changing various parameters and choosing the scene that better fits in a particular execution or interpretation. </p>"
